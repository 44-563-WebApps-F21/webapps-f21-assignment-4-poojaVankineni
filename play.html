        [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
        pockets_. _He is looking rather bored_.]
    </p>

        <p class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</p>
        <p class="stagedirection">[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.] </p>
        <p class="speech">It is a great nuisance. I can’t find any one in this house to
        talk to. And I am full of interesting information. I feel like the
        latest edition of something or other.</p>

        <p class="stagedirection">[_Enter servant_.]</p>

        <p class ="JAMES">JAMES</p>. 
        <p class ="speech">Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>

        <p class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</p> 
        <p class="speech">Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>

        <p class="JAMES">JAMES.</p>
        <p class="speech">Her ladyship has not yet left her room. Miss Chiltern has just
        come in from riding.</p> 

        <p class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</p> 
        <p class="speech">[_To himself_.] Ah! that is something.</p>

        <p class="JAMES">JAMES.</p> 
        <p class="speech">Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
        Robert. I told him your lordship was here.</p>

        <p class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</p> 
        <p class="speech">Thank you! Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>

        <p class="JAMES">JAMES.</p> 
        <p classs="speech">[_Bowing_.] I shall do so, my lord.</p>

        <p class="stagedirection">[_Exit servant_.]</p>

        <p class="LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</p>
        <p class="speech">Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
        It is a great deal too much excitement for any son. I hope to goodness
        he won’t come up. Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the
        only proper basis for family life. Mothers are different. Mothers are
        darlings.</p>

        begins to read it_.]</p>
