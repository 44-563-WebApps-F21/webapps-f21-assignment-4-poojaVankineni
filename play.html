        [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
        pockets_. _He is looking rather bored_.]

        LORD GORING. [_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.] It is a great nuisance. I can’t find any one in this house to
        talk to. And I am full of interesting information. I feel like the
        latest edition of something or other.

        [_Enter servant_.]

        JAMES. Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.

        LORD GORING. Lady Chiltern not down yet?

        JAMES. Her ladyship has not yet left her room. Miss Chiltern has just
        come in from riding.

        LORD GORING. [_To himself_.] Ah! that is something.

        JAMES. Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
        Robert. I told him your lordship was here.

        LORD GORING. Thank you! Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?

        JAMES. [_Bowing_.] I shall do so, my lord.

        [_Exit servant_.]

        LORD GORING. Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
        It is a great deal too much excitement for any son. I hope to goodness
        he won’t come up. Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the
        only proper basis for family life. Mothers are different. Mothers are
        darlings. [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
        begins to read it_.]

        [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]

        LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir, what are you doing here? Wasting your time
        as usual, I suppose?

        LORD GORING. [_Throws down paper and rises_.] My dear father, when one
        pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
        one’s own.

        LORD CAVERSHAM. Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
        last night?

        LORD GORING. I have been thinking about nothing else.

        LORD CAVERSHAM. Engaged to be married yet?

        LORD GORING. [_Genially_.] Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.

        LORD CAVERSHAM. [_Caustically_.] You can have till dinner-time if it
        would be of any convenience to you.

        LORD GORING. Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
        lunch.

        LORD CAVERSHAM. Humph! Never know when you are serious or not.

        LORD GORING. Neither do I, father.

        [_A pause_.]

        LORD CAVERSHAM. I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?

        LORD GORING. [_Airily_.] The Times? Certainly not. I only read _The
        Morning Post_. All that one should know about modern life is where the
        Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.

        LORD CAVERSHAM. Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
        article on Robert Chiltern’s career?

        LORD GORING. Good heavens! No. What does it say?

        LORD CAVERSHAM. What should it say, sir? Everything complimentary, of
        course. Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
        one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
        Canning.

        LORD GORING. Ah! Never heard of Canning. Never wanted to. And did . . .
        did Chiltern uphold the scheme?

        LORD CAVERSHAM. Uphold it, sir? How little you know him! Why, he
        denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
        This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
        out. You should read this article, sir. [_Opens_ The Times.] ‘Sir
        Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
        Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
        . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
        to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’ They will
        never say that of you, sir.

        LORD GORING. I sincerely hope not, father. However, I am delighted at
        what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted. It shows he has got
        pluck.

        LORD CAVERSHAM. He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.

        LORD GORING. Ah! I prefer pluck. It is not so common, nowadays, as
        genius is.
